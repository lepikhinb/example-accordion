          <p>
            You are in control of how much information you share on Twitter or any other website. Donâ€™t post information
            you consider to be private, and be thoughtful about when you want to publicly share your location.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be wary of any communication that asks for your private contact information, personal information, or
            passwords. If you are ever unsure before you Tweet, we recommend you ask yourself the following questions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Who am I sharing this information with?</li>
            <li>How much and what type of information am I sharing?</li>
            <li>How many people can see the information I am sharing?</li>
            <li>Can I trust all the people that see this information?</li>
          </ul>
